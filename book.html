		 <h2>🎓 How It All Started</h2>
                <p>
                    We were in college together but never really got to know each other.  
                    Life had its own plans when we joined <b>MBA classes in Nagpur</b>.  
                    What started as simple greetings slowly turned into longer conversations.  
                    And just like that, our friendship took root. 
                </p>
				<p>
            I still remember how we would sit in class, sometimes pretending to listen  
            while secretly sharing smiles and whispers.  
            Those classes weren’t just about learnin,they were the foundation of our love story.

          <p>I still remember the day you asked me,  
             <b>"Will you marry me?"</b>  
             I was shocked and didn’t know how to respond.  
             My mind stopped for a moment, but my heart was full of happiness.  
             Inside, I was smiling like a kid who just got the best gift ever.
                </p>
				 <p>
            You proposed to me on a call that night,  
            <b>after 11 PM</b>.  
            I never expected it, but it became one of the most special moments of my life. 🌙❤️

            You are not just beautiful to look at; your personality makes you even more special🎓👩‍🎓.
          </p>

            I still remember those days, when I was traveling alone from <b>Nagpur to Amravati</b>🚗🏡.  
            You always stayed on call with me until I reached home safely.  
            Your care made me feel so loved, and I knew I had someone who truly cared for me.

                   <p> Pune became our special place.  
                    We spent time watching movies, talking for hours, and laughing nonstop.  
                    And of course, we never missed our favorite chicken dishes at <b>Sarjaa</b>😋.  
                    Every visit made us happier, and every memory became precious.

            I still remember how we used to walk through the streets of Pune,

            We never expected the marriage talk to happen that day.
